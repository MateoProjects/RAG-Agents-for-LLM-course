    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we introduced some key LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) material regarding runnables. By now, you should be comfortable with both internal and external reasoning, as well as how to develop pipelines that facilitate it! In this notebook, we will make our way towards more advanced paradigms that will allow us to orchestrate more complex dialog management strategies and begin to execute on longer-form document reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning how to leverage runnables to orchestrate interesting LLM systems.  \n",
    "- Understanding how running state chains can be used for dialog management and iterative decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Questions To Think About:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Would there ever be a use for a single-module variant of the running state chain that is not constantly querying the environment for input?\n",
    "- You may notice that the JSON prediction is actually working pretty well. It might not always work so well depending on the questions and the JSON format complexity. What kinds of issues do you expect to encounter in this regard?\n",
    "- What kinds of approaches can you think of completely swapping prompts as part of the running state chain?\n",
    "\n",

    "The example above is just a toy example and, if anything, showcases the drawbacks of chaining many LLM calls together for internal under-the-hood reasoning.

    "\n",
    "To build a responsive and intelligent system, we need a method that not only processes inputs but also retains and updates essential information through the flow of conversation. This is where the combination of LangChain and Pydantic becomes pivotal. [**Pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a popular Python validation library, is instrumental in structuring and validating data models. As one of its features, Pydantic offers structured \"model\" classes that validate objects (data, classes, themselves, etc.) with simplified syntax and deep rabbitholes of customization options. This framework is used throughout LangChain and comes up as a necessary component for use cases that involve data coersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that a \"model\" is very good for is defining a class with expected arguments and some special ways to validate them! In this course, we won't focus too much on the validation scripts, but those interested can start by checking out the [**Pydantic Validator guide**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/validators/) (though the topics do get pretty deep pretty fast). For our purposes, we can construct a `BaseModel` class and define some `Field` variables to create a structured **Knowledge Base** like so:"

Please ask the user for clarification or help them with known information.\"`*\n",
