    "## **Part 4: [Exercise]** Rhyme Re-themer Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a poetry generation example that showcases how you might organize two different tasks under the guise of a single agent. The system calls back to the simple Gradio example, but extends it with some boiler-plate responses and logic behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's primary feature is as follows:\n",
    "- On the first response, it will generate a poem based on your response.\n",
    "- On subsequent responses, it will keep the format and structure of your original rhyme while modifying the topic of the poem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** At present, the system should function just fine for the first part, but the second part is not yet implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Implement the rest of the `rhyme_chat2_stream` method such that the agent is able to function normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the gradio component easier to reason with, a simplified `queue_fake_streaming_gradio` method is provided that will simulate the gradio chat event loop with the standard Python `input` method"
