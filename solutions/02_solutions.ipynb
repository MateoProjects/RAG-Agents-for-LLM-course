    "To start out, let's use the provided `requests` boilerplate from an LLM model's API entry. Perhaps `Llama-2-13B` or `mixtral-7bx8`is a reasonable candidate, but feel free to try your own and consider the pool of active options.\n",
    "\n",
    "To query the model, you can paste the code for the python routine in the cell below. It is much easier to use the streaming script in Python thanks to some special features of the `requests` library, so we have provided some hints to get that started for you. *Feel free to try the non-streaming way if you have the time and interest.*\n",

    "**NOTE:** If you would like, you can bypass this exercise by simply clicking the `Execute` button under the code block. Doing this will show what happens when you try to invoke the provided example."
