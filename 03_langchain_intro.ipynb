    "In the previous notebook, we introduced some of the services we'll be taking advantage of for our LLM applications, including some external LLM platforms and a locally-hosted front-end service. Both of these components incorporate LangChain, but it hasn't been spotlighted as a major focus yet. It is expected that you have some experience with LangChain and LLMs, but this notebook is intended catch you up to the level necessary to progress through the rest of the course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to guide you through the integration and application of LangChain, a leading orchestration library for Large Language Models (LLMs), with the AI Foundation Endpoints from last time. Whether you are a seasoned developer or new to LLMs, this course will enhance your understanding and skills in building sophisticated LLM applications.\n",

    "### **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning how to leverage chains and runnables to orchestrate interesting LLM systems.  \n",
    "- Getting familiar with using LLMs for external conversation and internal reasoning.\n",
    "- Be able to start up and run a simple Gradio interface inside your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Questions To Think About:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What kinds of utilities might be necessary to keep information flowing through the pipeline **(primer for next notebook)**.\n",
    "- When you encounter the `gradio` interface, consider where all you have seen this style of interface before. Some possible places may include [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces), but did you know that the NGC playground environments for foundation models use it? Hypothesize what kinds of options `gradio` might allow to make this level of flexibility possible?\n",
    "- Near the end of the section, you'll learn that you can pass around chains as routes and access them across environments via ports. What kinds of requirements should you advertise if you are trying to recieve chains from other microservices?\n",

So for all intents and purposes, it is a \"building-block system\" abstraction where the building blocks are easy to create, have consistent methods (`invoke`, `generate`, `stream`, etc), and can be linked up to work together as a system. Some example legacy chains include `LLMChain`, `ConversationChain`, `TransformationChain`, `SequentialChain`, etc.\n",

Allow dictionaries to be implicitly converted to Runnables and let a **pipe |** operator create a Runnable that passes data from the left to the right (i.e. `fn1 | fn2` is a Runnable), and you have a simple way to specify complex logic!\n",

The goal of a [**`RemoteRunnable`**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve) is to make it easy to host a LangChain chain as an API endpoint, so the following is just a test to make sure that it works.\n",
    "    - If it doesn't work the first time, there may be an order-of-operations issue. Feel free to try and restart the langserve notebook. LangServe is still rather early in its life cycle (v0.0.35) so some issues may be encountered.\n",
    "- Assuming that your local instance is fine, open a new tab, copy your address up until right before the first \"/lab\", and try to access the `:8090` port (i.e. `http://<...>.courses.nvidia.com:8090`). This will contain the deployment of the [**`frontend`**](frontend) folder which you can interact with.\n",
